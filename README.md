# Zillow-house-price-prediction

**Introduction-**
A home is often the largest and most expensive purchase a person makes in his or her lifetime..The price of a house can be determined by its features and the locality in which it is located and thats what the Zillow company does,it determines the estimated price of a house based on its features and locality.In this project we are provided with the dataset by the Zillow company which contains the characteristics of multiple houses along with the infomation of their location and we are going to use machine learning to make the most out of the data and make the estimates made by the Zillow group more accurate.

**Goal-**
This is a Machine learning project used for predicting the log-error between the estimated value and actual sale price of a house using all the features of a home which are used to find the estimate value of the house. The use of this project is to find the range of the price of a house which can be considered by taking the estimation of the price and the log-error into consideration.
